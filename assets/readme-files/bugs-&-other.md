Checked to see if img in the image query Selector was affecting the malfunction of the play button: =negative after testing on the deployed page.

Added 7 sound-picker buttons & added the seven chakra colours using hex in order to each button for to represent a chakra.

Changed image & button sizes to make them more responsive after testing on browser with dev tools. Change to image sizes to rem & text to em to make more responsive.

Added different types & forms of meditation which I intend to build on overtime. Adding a different page for each form of meditation from Transcendental - Sahaja Yoga - Mindful - Body scan to creating my own guided meditations in the near future.

Creating value by providing various options on the types of meditation & different times to make accessible to new people finding out about meditation.

Struggling with buttons & positioning. The buttons do not work on the deployed page so i have uploaded my own buttons & finding it difficult to position the repeat button

Started out with a video background but this was not responsive, so ths need to be transformed to work effectively with images 

I decided to take the z-index: -1 off to focus on fixing the background size in the browser. 

Thanks to dev ed (YouTube channel + github). After trial & error plus a lot of research & testing, I managed to resolve the image covering the screen with responsiveness by adding min-width 100% + max-width 100%

Fixed the JavaScript error with the play button, when I pressed it, it malfunctioned. 

New statement added to media query to make tooltip dissapear.

Media queries were needed more than I realised after testing on my phone & toggle device toolbar. Working great on all toggle toolbar screens but not my phone yet for some reason.
